 * 2.2 (Compute the volume of a triangle) Write a program that reads in the length of
 * sides of an equilateral triangle and computes the area and volume using the
 * following formulas:
 *  area = (âˆš3/4) * (length of sides)2
 *  volume = area * length
 *
 *  Here is a sample run:
 *      Enter length of the sides and height of the Equilateral
 *      triangle: 3.5
 *      The area is 3.89
 *      The volume of the Triangular prism is 19.48
