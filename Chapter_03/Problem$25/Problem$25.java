/**
 * *3.25 (Geometry: intersecting point) Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2,
 * y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure 3.8a and b.
 * The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear
 * equations:
 *  (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
 *  (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
 *  This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule
 *  (see Programming Exercise 3.3). If the equation has no solutions,
 *  the two lines are parallel (see Figure 3.8c)
 *  Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the
 *  intersecting point. Here are sample runs
 *
 *          Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4: 2 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
 *          The intersecting point is at (2.88889, 1.1111)
 *
 *          Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4: 2 2 7 6.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
 *          The two lines are parallel
