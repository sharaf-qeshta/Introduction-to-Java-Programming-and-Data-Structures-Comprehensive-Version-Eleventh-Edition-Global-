 * been created using the ObjectOutputStream from the preceding programming
 * exercises. The file contains Loan objects. The Loan class in Listing 10.2
 * does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class to implement
 * Serializable. Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and
 * displays the total loan amount. Suppose that you donâ€™t know how many Loan
 * objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
