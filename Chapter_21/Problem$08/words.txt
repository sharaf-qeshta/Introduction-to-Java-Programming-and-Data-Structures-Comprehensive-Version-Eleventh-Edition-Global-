(Count the occurrences of words in a text file) Rewrite Listing 21.9 to read the
text from a text file. The text file is passed as a command-line argument. Words
are delimited by whitespace characters, punctuation marks (,;.:?), quotation
marks ('"), and parentheses. Count words in case-insensitive fashion (e.g.,
consider Good and good to be the same word). The words must start with a letter.
Display the output in alphabetical order of words, with each word preceded
by its occurrence count
