/**
 * *7.30 (Pattern recognition: consecutive four equal numbers) Write the following method
 * that tests whether the array has four consecutive numbers with the same value:
 * public static boolean isConsecutiveFour(int[] values)
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers and
 * displays it if the series contains four consecutive numbers with the same value. Your
 * program should first prompt the user to enter the input sizeâ€”i.e., the number of
 * values in the series. Here are sample runs:
 *
 *          Enter the number of values: 8
 *          Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 5 5 4 5
 *          The list has consecutive fours
 *
 *          Enter the number of values: 9
 *          Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 6 5 5 4 5
 *          The list has no consecutive fours
