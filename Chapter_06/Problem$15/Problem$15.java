/**
 * *6.15 (Financial application: print a tax table) Listing 3.5 gives a program to compute
 * tax. Write a method for computing tax using the following header:
 * public static double computeTax(int status, double taxableIncome)
 * Use this method to write a program that prints a tax table for taxable income from
 * $50,000 to $70,000 with intervals of $100 for all the following statuses:
 *
 * Taxable Income   Single      Married Joint or Qualifying Widow(er)        Married Separate      Head of a House
 * 50000            8688        6665                                         8688                  7353
 * 50100            8713        6680                                         8713                  7378
 * ...
 * 69900            13663       9850                                         12328                 9840
 * 70000            13688       9875                                         12353                 9853
 *
 * Hint: round the tax into integers using Math.round (i.e., Math
 * .round(computeTax(status, taxableIncome))).
